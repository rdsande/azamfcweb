                        Azam FC, started as Mzizima FC on 23 July 2004. The club was founded by the workers of Mzizima
                        wheat flour milling industry owned by Said Salim Bakhresa,(SSB) group of Companies, at Banda la
                        Ngozi, Nyerere Road, Ilala, Dar es Salaam.,
                        <br /><br />
                        Mzizima FC was a brainchild of Hafidh Salim (who became the first Chairperson), Ali Mlungula,
                        Seif Mshamu Kiwile, Athuman Kikila, Mohamed Saad Makununi, Mzee Chuli Ramadhan, and Babu Ayubu.
                        Then they were joined by Abubakar Mapwisa, Seleman Mabehewa, Twalib Suleiman Chuma, Mohamed Seif
                        'King', Nassor Idrisa 'Father', Ibrahim Jeshi and Abdallah Hassan. They started this team just
                        for recreation and leisure after the long working hours, so as to improve their social life,
                        health and well-being.

                        <br /><br />
                        They didn't have a place as their training ground thus they approached the Tanzania Railways
                        Limited (TRC) to allow them use their open space at Ilala Goods Shed. TRC gave them a nod
                        and
                        the work of leveling the ground started immediately.<br /><br />

                        After the ground was ready, they dubbed it, 'Surulele', after the legendary National
                        Stadium,
                        Lagos Nigeria where the Taifa Stars played in at the 1980 African Cup of Nations.

                        The ground allowed the players, who were the workers, to showcase their talents. The very
                        first
                        players are Nassor Idrisa, Salum Kakolo, Mjomba Akili, Salva Mayola, Ali Dosho, Gabriel
                        Sebastian Manyoronga, Mohamed Kikuni, Tebela, Zabron Mihangi, Salehe Hillary, Mussa Lumbi,
                        Hatibu Katoto, Amiri Rashid Kikwa, Hamis Jafar, Ibrahim Jaluo, Abbas Kuka, Mbaraka Shaaban
                        Jangama 'Cantona', Abdulkarim Amin 'Popat', Hassan Jeba, Said Nachikongo, Mussa Juma, Faraj
                        Ismail, Mazaila Athuman and James Adriano Kilongola.

                        After only playing friendly matches, in 2005, Mzizima FC participated in official league after
                        joining division four. This was the lowest official league in Tanzanian football pyramid, and
                        organized by the respective districts' football associations. Based in Ilala district of Dar es
                        Salaam, Mzizima FC joined the Ilala District League under Ilala District Football Association,
                        which was played in May, from 1st to 28th, at Benjamin Mkapa Secondary School ground, Ilala, Dar
                        es Salaam.<br /><br />

                        Mzizima FC made it to the final and saw off Ndanda FC of Misheni Kota, Kariakoo Dar es Salaam by
                        2–1, with the brace from Mussa Lumbi in front of Honourable Mussa Hassan Mussa, the Ilala Member
                        of Parliament.<br /><br />

                        Mr. Abubabar Bakhresa, the Managing Director of SSB, awarded the team a sum of 330,000/= for
                        winning the championship.<br /><br />

                        The win meant Mzizima FC was automatically promoted to Dar es Salaam regional league (division
                        three) for the 2006 season.

                        Other SSB owned industries had their own football teams too, and in 2005 they agreed to merger
                        with Mzizima SC to form one strong team following the suggestion from Mr. Abubabar Bakhresa, the
                        Managing Director of SSB. The teams were Kipawa [Biscuits & Bakery Industry], TAZARA - Buguruni
                        [Wheat Flour Milling & Mineral Water Industry] and Vingunguti [Omary Packaging &
                        Garage].<br /><br />

                        They decided to organize the tournament involving all these teams to help select the players to
                        form one new team. The tournament was played at Airwing ground in Ukonga. Mzizima FC and Kipawa
                        FC qualified for the final but the match was interrupted as Kipawa confronted the officiating.
                        <br /><br />
                        After the disputed tournament, every team maintained its status but later some players defected
                        from other teams to join Mzizima FC to honour the call of Mr. Abubakar Bakhresa. Some of them
                        were Luckson Kakolaki and Id Abubakary of Kipawa. This led to the strengthening of Mzizima SC
                        and weakening of other teams, and lately they swallowed their pride and agreed to merger with
                        Mzizima FC to form one team.
                        <br /><br />
                        On 28/10/2005, the newly formed team adopted the new name, Azam Sports Club, because Azam is the
                        flagship name for the SSB group of companies.

                        After winning the Ilala District Championship (division four) in 2005, Azam SC was automatically
                        promoted to the Dar es Salaam regional league (division three). But the regional league proved
                        to be a bit tough for Azam SC players who were workers from within the company.<br /><br />

                        The need to improve the team forced the recruitment of new players from outside the company. The
                        new players helped the team to win promotion to second division for 2007 season. But that was
                        the beginning of the new era because the club now started to pay wages to the players only for
                        playing football, thus the professionalization of the club.<br /><br />

                        On June 6, 2006, Azam Sports Club turned full professional and marked the evolution by dropping
                        'Sports Club' from its name, and replaced it with 'Football Club'. From that day on, the
                        official name of the club is Azam Football Club.<br /><br />

                        The players recruited for 2007 season were Seleman Matola, Shekhan Rashid, Kasimu Kilungo, Juma
                        Assey, Daud Jumanne, James Adrian, Makame Usi 'Vigema', Boniface Pawasa, Heri pazi, and Alimu
                        Chilumbe. Others were Kamba Luffo and Steven Nyenge.<br /><br />

                        These were the players who had vast experience of local and international football and improved
                        the team.

                        In April 2006, the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) announced that from 2007 they will change
                        the league system and calendar. The old calendar of January - December was to be replaced by the
                        new one of August - May. So to get the representatives in African competitions for 2007 (as CAF
                        still used February - November calendar), TFF organized what they called the LIGI NDOGO (mini
                        league).<br /><br />

                        Also all other leagues below premier league to be disbanded and replaced by new competition
                        called National League. This competition was to start from district level to the national level
                        in the same season. National level is where the promotion to the premier league was obtained.
                        Under this new format, the team could be formed the same season and got promoted to the premier
                        league in the same season.<br /><br />

                        So when the new season started, Azam FC which at the time was in division two, had to drop to
                        district level to participate in this new competition. They started from Ilala District and in
                        one of their matches they played against Cosmopolitan and lost 2–0, at Benjamin Mkapa Secondary
                        School ground. All goals were scored by the 17 year old, John Bocco.<br /><br />

                        Azam FC who eventually managed to qualify for regional level, signed John Bocco and enrolled him
                        for the rest of the season. They too signed a 16 year old Salum Abubakary 'Sure
                        Boy'.<br /><br />

                        Azam FC triumphantly made it all the way to National level for promotion playoffs. There were
                        two centers for playoffs, Dodoma and Musoma, and Azam FC was in Dodoma.<br /><br />

                        Their group included Mbagala Market, the team which had a 17 year old in Mbwana Samatta,
                        Majimaji FC and Kijiweni FC from Uyole Mbeya. The match against Mbagala Market which ended in a
                        stalemate was very intense and a reminder of the two previous encounters at regional, all ended
                        in a draw.<br /><br />

                        This is where the rivalry between Azam FC and Mbagala Market started. Mbagala Market, now
                        African Lyon, is the first team to beat Azam FC at Azam Complex Chamazi.

                        Azam FC was promoted after accumulating 7 points from two wins (3–0 against Kijiweni and 2–0
                        against Majimaji) and one draw (0-0 against Mbagala Market).<br /><br />

                        The promotion was officially sealed on July 27, 2008, after a comfortable 2–0 win over Majimaji
                        FC with free kick goals from John Bocco.

                        Since promotion, Azam FC have managed to finish in top three in all seasons, except 2008/09
                        [eighth] and 2016/17 [fourth].
